# üöÄ PythonOS - Cross-Platform Executable Builder

## üìú Overview
**PythonOS** is a versatile Python-based application designed to run seamlessly on **Windows, Linux, and Android (via Termux)**.  
This repository includes automated workflows that build platform-specific executables:  
- Windows: `.exe`  
- Linux: Script execution via Terminal
- Android: Script execution via Termux  

Whether you're a developer or user, this guide will help you download, install, and run MyApp on your preferred platform with ease.

## üì• Download & Installation

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows
1. Navigate to the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/Kalmai221/PythonOS/actions).
2. Select the latest **successful workflow run**.
3. Scroll to **Artifacts** and download `windows-exe.zip`.

### üì± Android (Termux)

Since Android does not support `.exe` natively, use **Termux** to run the Python script directly.

#### Setup Termux and Python:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install python python-pip
```

#### Installation Steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/Kalmai221/PythonOS/actions).
2. Download the latest `installer-runpy.zip` from the most recent successful run.
3. Extract the ZIP file inside Termux.
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes & Best Practices

* **Python Version:** Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed for compatibility.
* **Permissions:** On Linux and Android, you might need appropriate permissions to execute scripts or access certain directories.
* **File Paths:** The application expects to be run with access to the current working directory; avoid moving extracted files arbitrarily.
* **Security:** Download artifacts only from trusted releases to prevent security risks.
* **Feedback & Issues:** For bugs, feature requests, or support, please open an issue on the repository.
